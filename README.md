# Popular Movies
A simple Android app, that helps user to discover movies. 
This is Project 1 of Udacity's Associate Android Developer Fast Track.
##Getting Started
App uses [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) API to retrieve movies. 
You must provide your own API key in order to build the app. 
When you get it, just paste it to `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` file (create the file if it does not exist already):
```gradle
MyMovieDbApiKey="<UNIQUE_API_KEY>"
```
